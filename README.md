# School District Analysis with Python

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The school board noticed evidence of academic dishonesty, specifically with the Thomas High School ninth grade reading and math grades. Our objective is to repeat the school district analysis after we replace the Thomas High School ninth grade reading and math grades with NaN values while keeping the rest of the data the same.


### Resources

- Data Source: [schools_complete.csv](Resources/schools_complete.csv), [students_complete.csv](Resources/students_complete.csv)
- Software: Python 3.7.9, pandas 1.1.3, numpy 1.19.2, jupyter-notebook 6.1.4, Visual Studio Code 1.52.1

### Procedure


### Analysis
<!--
There is a bulleted list that addresses how each of the seven school district metrics was affected by the changes in the data (10 pt).
Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.''

-Scores by school spending
-Scores by school size
-Scores by school type
